# Networking

## The Flood
I don't know anyone entering the industry these days that has found a job through cold applying. With the influx of many international bootcamps and the shrinking of the tech industry, there is a flood junior market. If you are curious, a lot of this has to do with covid: 
- Previously in-person programs became remote, making them more accessible
- Bootcamps during/after lockdown saw a significant increase in enrollment due to people looking for new job opportunities that would be `pandemic proof`. 
Since Fullstack Development was already an established program for a lot of companies, the market ballooned.
- The lockdown tech boom led to increased hiring for developers, which pushed bootcamps to increase marketing and attract new demographics. At the time it seemed like the growth would never end. 

Back when I graduated bootcamp in 2018, a majority of my classmates had an offer before we even graduated. For reference, there were 11 people in my cohort, and only 3 cohorts/year, and we lived in a city where there was only really one other "bootcamp" program, which was a 2 year program offered by a college. By 2021 the same company was producing hundreds of grads a month in Western Canada while another 4 companies opened up shop with similar numbers and traditional colleges launching expedited programs. What this means is that finding a job as a junior is pretty much as hard as it has ever been.

## How To Network

You have 2 options: 
1. networking in person 
2. networking online. 

The best thing you can do is both. If you are able to, networking in person will generally go a lot further. People love human connection. Obviously that is not always possible depending on your location and life situation, but if you find any opportunity to network in person then you need to take it!

Both topics are covered in depth in this folder, so go check them out!

## Things to keep in mind

Networking shouldn't feel transactional. Sometimes a good connection won't pay off until much later, and that is okay. Not everyone you meet will be hiring right now, or hiring juniors. You are at the start of a long career so take time to appreciate the people who you are getting to know. Be genuine, be kind, be aware of the relationship you are building with another real human.
