# IRL Networking

## Where to look
I am constantly asked on Reddit what events to go to by developers across the world. Unfortunately, I could not possibly know every market, so you will need to do some digging yourself. Here are the tools that I use where I live (Calgary, AB, Canada) to find meetups. 

- Event websites like meetup or eventbrite (this may vary depending on location)
- Your local startup community
- Your municipal/state/provincial website: check to see if they have an innovation or tech centre
- Your bootcamp alumni network(s)
- Local Slack Communities or Discord Servers (likely found via one of the above)

## What to target
You could go to a huge conference and listen to a bunch of speakers, sure. And you should do that if there is a topic you are interested in and if you are financially able to. However, I think it is best to target smaller, nerdier meetups. Some of the best professional connections I've made have been through talking about D&D or LOTR and not coding at all. I once spoke with a dev who said they found their first job because they had a Nightmare Before Christmas backpack on at a conference--a CTO loved that movie and struck up a conversation and they were able to land their first job as a developer. Here is an ordered list of things to target: 
- Hackathons: These are the BEST opportunity. You bond with other devs and industry experts. These connections will be real and raw. The added bonus is that you will build something that can be added to your resume and gain valuable teamwork experience from the hackathon.
- Small reoccurring meetups: The nerdy 5 guy JS meetup is going to give you a lot more face time than any conference. Those are the guys who will remember you when an opportunity crosses their desk because most juniors are too intimidated to show up. 
- More casual/grassroute events: Find events that are targeted at your community. You want to build a networking with people who will look out for you and vice versa, these are the people who will do it.

## How to stay connected
Yes you can always ask to connect with someone you meet on a platform like LinkedIn! Don't be afraid to ask at the end of a conversation for that opportunity, otherwise that connection will be lost. 

Personally, I like to keep notes of who I meet and what we talk about. If it is a connection that I would like to have a longer conversation with, I try to follow up with something relevant to our previous conversation that isn't just asking for a job (unless they said to reach out about a specific job). EX: If you talked about using Create React App, maybe follow up in a week and ask them if they have any recommendations about what to use in it's place! Then you could follow up with some (light) details on a project that you are working on and the techstack that you hope to use. 

Remember that networking is planting seeds for your entire career, not just for your next opportunity.
